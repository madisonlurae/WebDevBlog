    <p>This week I decided to look into some early web development. According to my research, it was created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee. He was a scientist, and
        he invented the 'world-wide-web' with the intent of simplifying the process of sharing information between scientists and research facilities. The first web
        browser, also created by Berners-Lee, was made Christmas of 1990. Interestingly enough, this was months after the launch of the first version of Adobe Photoshop as
        well as the first search engine, Archie.

        In October 1991, Berners-Lee published the original 18 HTML tags. These consisted of &lt;title&gt; , &lt;nextid&gt; , &lt;a&gt; , &lt;isindex&gt; , &lt;plaintext&gt; , 
        &lt;listing&gt; , &lt;p&gt; , &lt;h1&gt; … &lt;h6&gt; , &lt;address&gt; , &lt;hp1&gt; , &lt;hp2&gt; …, &lt;dl&gt; , &lt;dt&gt; , &lt;dd&gt; , &lt;ul&gt; , &lt;li&gt; , 
        &lt;menu&gt; and &lt;dir&gt; . HTML and is still in use today, though now there is well over 100 tags. In the early stages of the internet, websites were just plain 
        HTML text. The first image wasn't seen until 1992, Javascript wasn't invented until 1995, and the first standard for css wasn't published until 1996. With these additions, websites began to be more 
        complex in appearance and function. The first online marketing tool was a Batman website created in 1995 and Amazon was one of the first online stores in 1994.

        Though all of internet history has only occured in the last 31 years, the progress made as the languages became more advanced and more people became interested 
        in both designing and using websites is extensive. It is definitely interesting to see how it all unfolded.
